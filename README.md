# Euro Football Hub ⚽

A real-time dashboard tracking the top 5 European football leagues — Premier League, Bundesliga, Serie A, La Liga, and Ligue 1.

## Features

- **Title & European Places** — title contenders highlighted with gold trophy icon and betting odds (%), no duplication with European spots
- **Relegation Battle** — teams near the drop zone with gap-to-safety tracking
- **Form Indicators** — last 5 results (W/D/L dots) for every team
- **Competition Badges** — shows which teams are still in UCL, UEL, UECL, and domestic cups (FA Cup, DFB-Pokal, Coppa Italia, Copa del Rey, Coupe de France)
- **Betting Odds** — DraftKings moneylines on upcoming matches
- **Upset Detection** — flags results that went against the pre-match favorite
- **Auto-refresh** — 5-minute cache during match hours, 30-minute off-peak
- **League Detail Pages** — full standings table, upcoming fixtures, recent results, news

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React 18 + Vite + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **Backend:** Express 5 (Node.js)
- **Data:** ESPN public API (no auth needed) + BBC Sport RSS
- **Odds:** DraftKings (via ESPN) + Oddschecker (hardcoded title odds)

## Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Opens on `http://localhost:5000`. The Express server handles both the API and the Vite dev server.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

Builds the React frontend and bundles the Express server into `dist/index.cjs`.

## Deployment

### Railway (Recommended — simplest)

1. Connect this repo to [Railway](https://railway.app)
2. Set start command: `npm start`
3. Set build command: `npm run build`
4. Deploy — that's it. Railway runs the full Node server.

### Render

1. Connect this repo to [Render](https://render.com)
2. Create a **Web Service**
3. Build command: `npm install && npm run build`
4. Start command: `npm start`
5. Deploy.

### Vercel

A `vercel.json` is included. Note that Vercel uses serverless functions, so the in-memory cache resets between cold starts. The app still works but may be slightly slower than Railway/Render since each cold start re-fetches from ESPN.

1. Connect this repo to [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
2. It should auto-detect the config from `vercel.json`
3. You may need to run `npm run build` locally first and commit the `dist/` folder, or adjust the build settings in Vercel's dashboard.

> **Recommendation:** Railway or Render are the better fit here because this is a long-running Express server with in-memory caching. Vercel's serverless model means every function invocation could be a cold start.

## Data Sources

- **Standings, matches, form, zones:** ESPN public API (`site.api.espn.com`)
- **Match odds:** DraftKings via ESPN (available for EPL, Bundesliga, Serie A, Ligue 1)
- **Title odds:** Oddschecker (hardcoded snapshot — update in `server/espn.ts` → `TITLE_ODDS`)
- **News:** ESPN + BBC Sport RSS feed
- **Competition tracking:** ESPN scoreboard API scanned daily across domestic cups and European tournaments

No API keys required. All data sources are public.

## Updating Title Odds

Title odds are hardcoded in `server/espn.ts` in the `TITLE_ODDS` constant. Update the percentages periodically from Oddschecker or your preferred odds source. Teams below 5% implied probability are filtered out of the title contender highlighting.
